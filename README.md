Epidemiological study using WHO and UNDP datasets to quantify the relationship between gender inequality and breast cancer survival across countries.


# Gender Inequality and Breast Cancer Survival  
**A Cross-National Global Health Data Analysis (2022)**

This project is an independent epidemiological and biomedical data analysis examining how national-level gender inequality influences breast cancer survival outcomes across countries.

Using datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), I analyzed whether countries with higher gender inequality experience higher breast cancer case-fatality rates, a proxy for late diagnosis, limited access to treatment, and systemic healthcare inequities.

## Research Question
**To what extent does gender inequality predict breast cancer case-fatality rates across countries with different levels of human development?**

---

## Why This Matters
Breast cancer is one of the most treatable cancers when detected early, yet survival rates vary drastically across the world. These differences are shaped not only by medical technology, but by social and economic systems that determine:

- Access to screening and early diagnosis  
- Availability of treatment and oncology services  
- Health education and women’s autonomy  
- National investment in healthcare  

This project quantifies how gender inequality acts as a systems-level determinant of medical outcomes.

## Data Sources
- WHO (2022) — Breast cancer incidence and mortality by country  
- UNDP (2022) — Gender Inequality Index (GII) and Human Development Index (HDI)

Countries were selected using stratified sampling across low, medium, high, and very high HDI tiers to ensure global representativeness.

## Methodology

1. **Case-Fatality Rate (CFR)**

2. **Stratified Sampling**  
Countries were grouped by HDI to control for development-level differences.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
- Pearson correlation between GII and CFR  
- Significance testing (p-value)  
- Data visualization

4. **Confounder Control**  
HDI was used to contextualize healthcare infrastructure and national development.

## Key Results

- Strong positive correlation between gender inequality and breast cancer case-fatality rate  
- Pearson r = 0.833  
- p < 0.0001 (statistically significant)

This indicates that countries with higher gender inequality experience significantly worse breast cancer survival outcomes.

---

## Interpretation

Higher gender inequality is associated with:
- Later diagnosis  
- Reduced access to screening  
- Limited oncology care  
- Structural barriers for women seeking medical treatment  

These findings demonstrate that medical outcomes are deeply influenced by social systems, not just clinical technology.

## Relevance to Biomedical Engineering

This project connects biomedical engineering, data science, and global health by:
- Applying statistical modeling to medical outcomes  
- Using real-world healthcare datasets  
- Identifying where diagnostic and treatment technologies are most needed  
- Supporting equitable deployment of medical innovation
